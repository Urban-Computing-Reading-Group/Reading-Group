2.Learning Stable Graphs from Multiple Environments with Selection Bias <br>

**Summary:**<br>
*This work solves the problem of learning stable graphs from multiple environments with selection bias. The motivation is that the data collection process of graph generation is full of known or unknown sample selection biases, leading to spurious correlations among entities. It achieves this by proposing a SGL framework, which consists of a GCN module for structure embedding and a designed E-VAE for high-dimensional sparse set generation.* <br>

1.Stable Prediction with Model Misspecification and Agnostic Distribution Shift<br>

**Summary:**<br>
*This paper focus on the problem of the different distribution between the train data and test data on linear regression. Author consider that vanishing the unstable loss, which easier effect by environment, to maintain a general minimal loss for any environment. Thus, by formula derivation, vanishing the unstable loss is equal to remove the correlation among all sample. It could be think that a noval approach to reweight the sample on linear regression.* <br>

1.Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning with Differentiable Pooling<br>

**Summary:**<br>
*This work solves the problem of graph-level classification. The motivation is to iteratively perform node clustering and node pooling until a final node is left, which is then used to represent the entire graph. In each iteration, it softly assigns each node to a cluster based on the node feature, then derives the representation of each cluster as well as the connections between the clusters from the node assignment to form a high-level graph.*<br>

2.InfoGraph: Unsupervised and Semi-supervised Graph-Level Representation Learning via Mutual Information Maximization<br>

**Summary:**<br>
*This work solves the problem of unsupervised graph-level representation learning. The motivation is to maintain the information of each subgraphs with different granularity in the representation of the entire graph. It achieves this by maximizing the mutual information between the representation of the entire graph and the representation of each subgraphs (yielded as an intermediate in the process of graph representation learning).*<br>

1.Deep Spatio-Temporal Residual Networks for Citywide Crowd Flows Prediction<br>

**Summary:**<br>
*This work solves the problem of forecasting the flow of crowds in each and every region of a city. The motivation is that this problem is of great importance to traffic management and public safety. It achieves this by convolution-based residual networks to model nearby and distant spatial dependencies between any two regions in a city.*<br>
